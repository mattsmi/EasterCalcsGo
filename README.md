Calculations in Go (Lang) for the various dates of Easter

Calculating Easter in Python 3
==============================

Calculates the date of Easter in Go, according to the Julian, Revised Julian, and Gregorian calendars.

Requires two arguments:
  * -y {year}, in which to calculate Easter (in format "YYYY");
  * -c {calendar}, the calendar to use (1 = Julian, 2 = Revised Julian, 3 = Gregorian).

Both arguments are optional; if it is not used, the script will default to calculatig Easter according to the Gregorian calendar for the current year.

Most Eastern Orthodox Churches use the Revised Julian calendar to calculate Easter, except the Russian Orthodox, Serbian Orthodox, and Mount Athos, which all use the Julian calendar.
